                        Using this site means you accept its terms. Don't be put off by the legalese, but please read these terms and
                        conditions of use carefully before using this website. This user agreement is needed mostly to make sure that our
                        good deed of putting all this great stuff on the net goes unpunished, and to emphasize that publication rights are
                        not being given away. "Look but don't touch." The goal is for you to enjoy viewing these historic treasures on the
                        CineFlix website, not to keep them locked away out of sight, but theft of content from this website will seriously anger
                        our generous donors who have allowed their rare and valuable collections to be displayed here and will put our
                        entire project in jeopardy, so please contact us when we can be of help, or if you have ideas about how to do this
                        better, but please don't get mad at us for only being able to let you see these wonderful torrents until you obtain
                        permission for other use as we attempt to deal as best we can with technological limitations, legal requirements,
                        and our need to pay the bills to keep this site open, and don't send us a rant without first reading our rants page.
                        If you do not intend to be legally bound by these terms and conditions, please do not access or use this website.
                        That said, let the contract begin:
                        <br /><br />
                        BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

                        <br /><br />

                        RESTRICTED ACCESS: This End User License Agreement ("User Agreement") grants you, personally and individually, a
                        non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited license, permitting access only for the use of
                        immediately electronically displaying content retrieved from this website, a copyrighted publication entitled
                        "YTS," including but not limited to visual and documentary resources, using a web browser in real time to no more
                        than one person at a time for personal, non-commercial, educational purposes, for reference use only, subject to
                        the limitations set forth herein. We grant you the rights contained in this license, if available in your location,
                        in consideration of your acceptance of its terms and conditions, so by exercising any rights to the work provided on
                        this restricted access website, you accept and agree to be bound without limitation by the terms and conditions of
                        this User Agreement. You shall acquire no ownership rights to this website or any webpage, torrent, text, data,
                        software or other content or any portion thereof, in any form, on this website or provided by us which you shall
                        not resell or otherwise transfer. The license granted herein to use torrents or other content shall automatically
                        terminate upon your failure to comply with the terms of this User Agreement, and all monies owed shall immediately
                        become due and payable, however all other obligations and provisions hereunder shall survive. All torrents are for
                        private non-commercial educational viewing purposes only. Except as explicitly permitted, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR COPY
                        TORRENTS FROM THIS WEBSITE! Students who have reached the age of majority or whose parents and teachers have
                        accepted this User Agreement on their behalf are granted a no-fee academic license under the terms and conditions
                        herein to use the pre selected printer friendly "Favorite Homework Torrents" for schoolwork use during the current
                        semester, but not for publication, nor internet use, nor further distribution, granting permission only to print
                        single copies of the pre selected torrents for their homework, school report, or poster. (Ask us for permission to
                        use other torrents for homework.) Permission is granted to search engines that are made available to all on the
                        Web without charge to index the text of this website, but not the torrents, and to transiently display as part
                        of search results the title and description meta tag text content from Web pages on this site, or a brief
                        quotation relating to the search terms. Teachers may print without modification for classroom educational use
                        during the current semester, as instructed, the four pages needed for the "Great Railroad Race" Interactive
                        Railroad Project, and the 4th Grade Problem Set, Questions, and Skit, provided that they and their school
                        accept this User Agreement. All other access, use, disclosure, reproduction, delayed use, reduction to
                        human-perceivable form, printing, copying or saving of digital torrent files or other content, reformatting,
                        file sharing, downloading, uploading, storing, posting, mirroring, archiving, recording, distributing,
                        redistribution, repurposing, modification, rewriting, manipulation, creation of derivative works, translations,

                        reporting, publication (in whole or part) or transmission whether by http, ftp, electronic mail or any other
                        file transfer protocol, and whether by electronic means or otherwise, or use by other than individual
                        scholars, or commercial use requires prior written permission of the rights owner(s) and payment of a fee,
                        and severe penalties apply for theft and unauthorized publication, which is also a crime. [Yes, we know that
                        you think that all this legalese is completely ridiculous, and we think so too, but we also believe that
                        current law unfortunately requires that it be done this way; So if you know of a better, simpler
                        "legally correct" way, do tell us how!] Each User and other person(s) or entity(ies) entering into this
                        agreement ("You") agree(s) to refrain from engaging in, or facilitating others in any such non-permitted
                        access or use. You agree to transfer and assign to yts.mx, without additional consideration, any rights,
